"""Turn decoded overlay rows into the payload the scanner already validates.

The seam is deliberate: `overlay_reader` owns pixels to rows, this module owns
rows to fields, and `NavPointScanner.parse_payload` owns fields to position
data. The reader emits the SAME payload shape a Vision response carries, so the
local path inherits the echo canaries, the plausibility gate, the mandatory unit
suffixes and the SolarSystem/Root agreement check unchanged. One validation
path, so a guard added for either reader cannot silently miss the other.

Everything here fails closed. `trusted` on a row means "every cell was read",
which is NOT the same as "this row contains a payload": a row rendered as
`Zone: Root Pos:` with the coordinates absent comes back trusted at cost 0.00,
and an opaque panel over part of the block decodes as confident spaces, which
truncates a coordinate mid-axis while leaving the row trusted with the right
label. Only a per-kind FULL-line shape rejects those, so every field below is
matched against the whole stripped text.

    **NOT THE RUNTIME PATH, and the name says so deliberately.** It routes
    through `payload_from_rows`, so it cannot produce a schema-1 coordinate
    stack and refuses every capture the legacy name-dependent parser refuses,
    including any Pyro body surface. `main.py` calls `capture_payload`, which
    dispatches to both parsers; a caller reaching for this one instead would
    silently lose stack support with no error and no failing test.

    It survives because two real-pixel join tests pin the legacy branch end to
    end, which is coverage worth keeping. `test_reader_entry_points` pins that
    no runtime module calls it.
