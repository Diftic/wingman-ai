"""Deterministic local reader for the r_displayinfo overlay.

Replaces the Vision AI call as the position source. Every confabulation
incident in this skill's history is a language model reading digits, so this
path emits characters it can prove from pixels and refuses everything else.

THE MODEL, all of it measured (LocalOcrPlan.md, Phase 1):

    observed = G * colour + H * background

  G  glyph coverage, measured on a black backdrop where `H * background`
     vanishes. Every instance of a character is bit-identical.
  H  what the background still transmits through the glyph and its one-pixel
     diagonal shadow: `(1 - G) * (1 - shift_down_right(G))`. A 2x2 maximum
     expansion incorrectly darkens the horizontal and vertical neighbours.
     See OCR_BACKGROUND_VALIDATION.md for real-pixel replay evidence.
  background is UNKNOWN and solved per cell per channel by least squares, which
  is what makes the reader background-agnostic.

Geometry, all measured: character pitch exactly 7.5 px, row pitch exactly 13,
glyph body 8 px tall, block right-aligned with its last ink column at screen
width minus 7. A line's left edge snaps to a whole pixel and characters then
advance by 7.5 px, so every glyph sits at sub-pixel phase 0.0 or 0.5.

The ordinary pass keeps conservative clipping guards. If it fails on brightness,
the runtime can retry coordinates with read_bright_coordinates; exact spacing,
small-mark ambiguity checks and scanner validation remain mandatory. Neural OCR
is not used as a coordinate authority. See OCR_BACKGROUND_VALIDATION.md for
measured coverage and remaining limits.

Rows are identified by their LABEL and then classified by their CONTENT, never
by row index: which lines appear changes with context (in a base, on foot, in a
ship, seated), though the spacing never does.

# 1. Conservative ordinary-pass precondition. Historically the two

#    Across 20 real frames plus gamma variants the worst SAFE row reaches 5.91
#    per cent and the best UNSAFE row never drops below 29.41, so 15 sits in a
#    23-point empty gap. Rejects 9 of 153 real screenshots.
#    The coordinate-only brightness retry can recover some such captures when
#    their shadow/glyph pixels survive; this statistic alone cannot prove loss.
CLIP_LEVEL = 250
ROW_CLIP_REJECT = 0.15

# 2. Ink contradiction: a cell that decodes blank while containing ink. The
#    threshold is HYBRID, not absolute, and the hybrid form is essential. A flat
#    50 misfires on 14.6 per cent of decoder-accepted blanks over a structured
#    background (measured inside the Nyx glacier ring), which would refuse most
#    rows in most of space; the relative term lifts the threshold above ordinary
#    background variation. K in 4 to 8 behaves identically: 6/6 real breaches
#    caught, 0 false positives on both smooth and structured populations.
#    HONEST LIMIT: on a structured row the threshold rises above the spread a
#    DIMMED glyph would show, so this guard loses the dimming class exactly
#    where backgrounds are busy. It is not the primary defence there; cost is.
INK_ABSOLUTE = 50.0
INK_RELATIVE_K = 6.0

# 3. Flat-white, the third layer, closing the one full-clip case the other two
#    miss. Real captured background never achieves a bit-flat interior: across
#    159 blank cells on a blown sky the spread never fell below 9, because
#    compression, quantisation and gradients always leave variation. Only
#    genuine clipping produces perfect flatness, so a spread floor of 5 selects
#    for "flat because DESTROYED" rather than "flat because bright". Fired 0
#    times in 1980 real blank cells, including 1440 structured ones.
FLAT_SPREAD_MAX = 5.0
FLAT_MEAN_MIN = 250.0
FLAT_ABOVE_BACKGROUND = 40.0

# 4. Per-cell clipped fraction, the companion the row statistic cannot replace.
#    Clipping ONE cell to 100 per cent (simulated bloom behind a character)
#    leaves the row at 3.09 per cent and the frame at 2.17, both comfortably

# Lines recognised by their label. The label is only the first stage, and it is
# never enough on its own: `overlay_fields` then matches each consumer field
# against a FULL-line shape, because `trusted` does not mean "contains a
# payload" (a row rendered as `Zone: Root Pos:` with the coordinates absent
# comes back trusted at cost 0.00, and an opaque occluder over part of the block
# decodes as confident spaces, truncating a coordinate while leaving the row
# trusted). Two to four rows per frame also share `kind == "zone"`, so the ship
# zone, `OOC_`, `SolarSystem_` and `Root` are told apart by content, not label.
#
# The label is SEARCHED FOR, never anchored at position 0, for the same reason
# `overlay_fields._largest_component` searches: the block is right-aligned, so
# every row carries a blank left margin, and a background star inside that
# margin decodes as a phantom glyph. `? CamDir: 179   0  133 FOV: 55 ...` failed
# a `^CamDir:` anchor, came back with `kind` None, and a CamDir row with no kind
# cannot be cleared by `ooc_hypothesis_refuted`, so the whole capture refused.
# Observed 2026-08-01 at P5 L2 on 3 of 15 consecutive frames as the star drifted
# through the block. Searching is the more permissive form, so it was measured
# rather than argued: over all 552 frames of the capture corpus, 6609 decoded
# rows, it moved 410 rows from NO kind to their own and 0 rows from one kind to
# a different kind. 9 of the 19 sessions were losing rows this way, so P5 L2 is
# where it was caught, not where it was confined.
#
# ORDER IS SAFETY-BEARING, and only became so when this started searching. Under
# anchoring the order was inert: no label is a prefix of another and a row has
# one position 0, so at most one entry could ever match. Searching means a row
# carrying two labels resolves by LIST PRIORITY, so whichever entry sits first
# wins.
#
# `zone` therefore goes FIRST, because it is the only kind that does not clear
# `overlay_fields.ooc_hypothesis_refuted`: every other kind is in
# `_NOT_ZONE_KINDS` and short-circuits the gate to cleared. Putting the sole
# gate-BLOCKING label anywhere but first is the fail-open direction, and
# `camdir` held that slot purely by inheritance from the anchored version.
# A constructed row proves the risk was real rather than theoretical:
# `Zone: OOC_Pyro_1_?? Pos: 1.0km 2.0km 3.0km CamDir: 179   0  133` classifies
# as `camdir` under the old order and clears a gate that exists to stop a
# system-frame waypoint being stored on a rotating body. Verified by negative
# control: restoring the old order fails 5 tests in `test_label_order_priority`,
# including the one asserting the row still BLOCKS the space branch.
#
# This costs nothing to fix: 0 of the 6609 decoded rows in the corpus carry two
# labels, so no observed behaviour changes. It only removes a shape the reader
# had no defence against.
