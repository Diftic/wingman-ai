"""The observation model: what one capture attempt IS, and how state carries
forward when the next attempt fails.

Wave 2 of `Supercalifragilistic.md` asks for the internal, immutable
observation type the rest of the reader will eventually be built around,
before any producer, epoch, or lane exists to fill it in. This module answers
section 7's "observation contract" and section 12's "temporal policy" as pure
data and pure functions, matching `coordinate_stack.py`: no Wingman runtime,
no OCR, no database, no logging, no threading, no clock reads. Every function
here takes `now` from its caller.

The hazard this file exists to prevent is confusion between "a good answer",
"the last good answer", and "no answer" (`Supercalifragilistic.md` sections 5
and 7). Section 12.4 states it exactly: a refused frame must NEVER refresh the
timestamp on the retained fix, and only an authoritative observation may be
saved, replace the nav fix, update distance, drive routing, or contribute to
arrival. `transition()` is the one place a new `Observation` is derived from
an old one plus a new attempt, and it is the one place both rules are
enforced: `Observation.__post_init__` refuses to construct an instance where
a temporal pass coexists with a failed hard gate. That guard runs on every
path through the public constructor, including `dataclasses.replace`; it
does not defend against `object.__setattr__` reaching around `__post_init__`
on an already-built instance, so read it as a strong constructor-time
guarantee, not an unconditional one.

class Observation:
    """One capture attempt's complete, immutable record.

    Plays two roles depending on `freshness`. While `freshness` is None, this
    is just the raw record of one attempt -- accepted or refused -- and is not
    yet the producer's retained state. Once `transition()` has processed it,
    `freshness` is `FRESHNESS_FRESH_AUTHORITATIVE` or `FRESHNESS_STALE_RETAINED`
    and the instance IS the retained state a consumer may read.

    `__post_init__` enforces the section-5 and 12.1 safety rules at
    construction time, rather than leaving them as conventions a caller could
    forget. These guarantees hold for every instance built through the public
    constructor or `dataclasses.replace`; none of them defend against
    `object.__setattr__` on an already-built instance.

    - `freshness` can only be non-None when both `hard_gate_result ==
      HARD_GATE_PASSED` and `temporal_result == TEMPORAL_PASSED`. A refused or
      temporally-rejected attempt therefore cannot be constructed with a
      non-None freshness, so `is_authoritative` and `freshness_state` cannot
      be fooled by a caller who forgot to check an outcome first.
    - `temporal_result` can only be `TEMPORAL_PASSED` or
      `OUTCOME_INCOMPATIBLE_FRAME_TRANSITION` when `hard_gate_result ==
      HARD_GATE_PASSED`; otherwise it must be `TEMPORAL_NOT_EVALUATED`. A
      temporal pass can therefore never coexist with a failed hard gate,
      which is section 12.1's "may reject, may never rescue" enforced at
      construction time rather than left as an undocumented convention.
    - `stack` may be non-None only when both gates passed. A refusal or
      rejection that somehow carried a stack would be exactly the ambiguity
      between "a good answer" and "no answer" section 7 exists to prevent.

    Attributes:
        capture_seq: Monotonically increasing capture sequence number.
        wall_clock_ts: Wall-clock timestamp (seconds), for presentation only.
        monotonic_ts: Monotonic timestamp (seconds), for age and velocity.
            Caller-supplied; this module never reads a clock.
        epoch: The AlignmentEpoch this attempt was decoded under.
        lane: LANE_STRUCTURAL or LANE_FAST.
        stack: The accepted CoordinateStack, or the accepted Root/Solar-only
            subset a fast-lane capture produces (a stack with no `nested`
            rows and no `candidate_depth` is already how `coordinate_stack`
            represents that). None when the attempt did not accept a stack.
        cam_dir: CamDir in degrees when present and trusted, else None.
        hard_gate_result: HARD_GATE_PASSED, or the specific OUTCOME_* failure
            (section 12.1 steps 1-6).
        temporal_result: TEMPORAL_NOT_EVALUATED, TEMPORAL_PASSED, or
            OUTCOME_INCOMPATIBLE_FRAME_TRANSITION (section 12.1 step 7).
        freshness: None while this is just an attempt record.
            FRESHNESS_FRESH_AUTHORITATIVE or FRESHNESS_STALE_RETAINED once
            `transition()` has made it the retained state.
        reason_code: A stable refusal or reacquisition reason code, for logs
            and tests. Free-form beyond stability, so a specific gate can
            report a more precise code than `hard_gate_result` or
            `temporal_result` alone carry.
        diagnostics: Diagnostic measurements already produced by the reader.
            Never exposed to the model (section 4.3). Coerced to a read-only
            `MappingProxyType` over a fresh copy in `__post_init__`, so
