main.py — SC NavPoint skill for Wingman AI
Author: Mallachi
Version: 4.9.0.27 (active-frame development candidate; live validation pending)

Mark and navigate to custom waypoints in Star Citizen using r_displayinfo 2
OCR. A waypoint belongs to a coordinate frame: the body-fixed local frame of a
planet or moon surface, or the star system's own frame for a point in open
space. The two are never mixed, since a coordinate means a different place in
each, so navigation across frames (and across bodies within the local frame) is
refused. Voice commands drop, list, and navigate to named positions.

# reader and one alignment cache, and an instance that never ran `__init__` has
# no lock of its own to use instead.
_FALLBACK_CAPTURE_LOCK = threading.Lock()

# The poll loop writes from its own thread and every tool call writes from the
# caller's, so two writers can reach the rotation together. Without this, both
# could pass the size check and both call `os.replace`, and the second would
# move a nearly empty fresh file over `.1` and destroy the generation the first
# had just preserved. Rare, and precisely the evidence loss that rotation was
# chosen over a size cap to prevent.
_POLL_LOG_LOCK = threading.Lock()

# A PER-CALLER CHANNEL for the outcome of the capture THAT caller asked for.
#
# The lock in `_capture_position_local` releases when that function returns,
# which is BEFORE `asyncio.to_thread` marshals the result back to the awaiting
# coroutine. The poll thread fires every second unattended, so between those two
# moments a whole second capture can finish and overwrite `self._last_outcome`,
# `self._scanner.last_reject_reason` and the one-shot badge latches. A caller
# reading them afterwards could be handed the OTHER capture's kind, and with it
# the console-command hint for an overlay it had just finished reading.
#
# A ContextVar and not an argument, because both capture seams have signatures
# and return types pinned by tests: the inner one must stay
# `(attempts) -> dict | None` and synchronous, the outer must stay a coroutine
# returning `dict | None`, and `CaptureOutcome` may not grow a field.
# `asyncio.to_thread` copies the caller's context into the worker thread, so the
# list put here before the call is the SAME list object the worker appends to.
#
# Module scope, not class scope: `test_capture_outcome.py` counts
# `_capture_lock` occurrences inside `inspect.getsource(main.SC_NavPoint)`, and
# a helper defined in the class body would sit inside that text.

        carries `capture_kind` and its own message. The caller retries, so the
