navigation.py — Bearing and direction calculations for SC NavPoint
Author: Mallachi

Declared scope: short-range surface navigation in a body-fixed local frame
(back to a cave, wreck, or outpost on the same planet or moon). The flat
Cartesian math here is intentional for that range. Far targets on a curved
surface therefore yield chord distance and through-the-planet bearings; that is
accepted for the declared scope, not a defect to fix. Positions from different
bodies live in different local frames and must never be mixed; callers enforce
that (this module never sees the body and does no cross-body check itself).

    """Camera basis in the star system's frame: (forward, right, up).

    CamDir is (pitch, roll, yaw), measured on 2026-07-28 by FLYING each vector
    and watching which coordinate moved, which is a stronger instrument than
    reading the numbers and interpreting them:

        CamDir (0, 0, 0)   -> flying forward increased Y only  -> forward is +Y
        CamDir (90, 0, 0)  -> nose pitched up                  -> pitch, + is up
        CamDir (0, 0, -90) -> yawed right, facing east         -> yaw, + is LEFT
        CamDir (0, 90, 0)  -> rolled right                     -> roll, + is right

    Note the yaw sign: yawing RIGHT reads NEGATIVE, so the yaw angle used below
    is the negation of the raw component. Two independent readings agreed on
    that ("looking east makes camdir 0 0 -90", then the same value again after
    the axis names were sorted out), which is why it is trusted; the middle
    reports that disagreed had pitch/roll/yaw in the wrong slots.

    The system frame is left-handed with +X east, +Y north, +Z up, origin at the
    star's centre. Facing north therefore puts east on your right, which is the
    handedness the same session's screenshot confirms: the star sat left of the
    crosshair exactly where a negative X component says it should.

    This is NOT `camdir_orientation`. That one was fitted in the body-fixed
    frame on a planet surface and validated there against the in-game compass,
    but only its FORWARD vector was ever tested, because a compass bearing is a
    forward direction. Applied out here it returns forward +X where the truth is
    +Y, with right and forward swapped: a mirror, not a rotation, which is why
    no single azimuth constant ever fixed it.

    Roll rotates right and up about forward, which the ring needs: the bubble
    is drawn on a screen that banks with the ship. A wrong roll sign leaves the
    total offset exact and mirrors the bubble as the ship rolls, so it would
    show up in flight and nowhere else.
