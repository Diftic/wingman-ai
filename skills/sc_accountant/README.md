## Installation

1. Add the `sc_accountant` skill folder to your Wingman AI `skills/` directory.
2. Assign the skill to a wingman in the Wingman AI configuration panel.
3. The skill auto-activates — no additional setup required.

### Dependencies

The core accounting tools work out of the box with Wingman AI's bundled
dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn` are already included). No extra packages
are needed.

---

## Configuration

All settings are available in the Wingman AI skill configuration panel:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Starting Balance** | `0` | Your current aUEC balance. Set once on first use. |
| **Auto-Sync Interval** | `30s` | How often to import trades from SC_LogReader. Set to `0` to disable. Only applies if SC_LogReader is installed. |
| **Currency Format** | `Full` | `Full` = `1,234,567 aUEC`. `Short` = `1.2M aUEC`. |
| **Complexity Tier** | `Engaged` | Controls which tools the AI suggests (see below). |
| **Auto-Generate Opportunities** | `true` | Generate trade opportunities when market data refreshes. |
| **Min Opportunity Profit** | `1,000` | Minimum profit threshold for generated opportunities. |
| **Auto-Track Positions** | `true` | Automatically open/close positions on commodity trades. |

### Complexity Tiers

- **Casual** — Basic income/expense tracking. Record transactions, check your
  balance, view a simple P&L. Ideal for players who just want to know where their
  money went.
- **Engaged** — Adds fleet management, trade positions, planning tools (break-even,
  ROI), credits/debts, and hauling. Good for traders and mission runners.
- **Industrial** — Full feature set including what-if scenario modeling and all
  dashboard tabs. For org leaders and industrial players.

## Limitations

### General
- **Single-player data only** — Each wingman instance maintains its own ledger.
  There is no multi-user database or cloud sync.
- **No real aUEC verification** — The system trusts what you tell it. Balances are
  tracked locally and cannot be verified against the game server.
- **Manual entry required without SC_LogReader** — Without the SC_LogReader sibling
  skill, all transactions must be recorded by voice or through the dashboard.

### Auto-Sync (SC_LogReader)
- Only captures **commodity and item trades** (buy/sell). Mission rewards, bounties,
  fines, fuel costs, and other non-trade events are not in the game log and must be
  recorded manually.
- Sync uses a line-number cursor — if the SC_LogReader ledger file is deleted or
  truncated, the cursor must be manually reset or duplicates may occur.

### Market Data
- Commodity prices are sourced from **UEX (uexcorp.space)** and cached locally.
  Prices may be up to 24 hours stale between refresh cycles.
- UEX data depends on community reporting — low-traffic terminals may have
  inaccurate or outdated prices.
- Trade route suggestions exclude out-of-stock and full-inventory terminals, but
  stock levels can change between the last UEX update and your actual trade.

### Web Dashboard
- Runs on `localhost:7863` — accessible only on the local machine.
- Requires an active Wingman AI session. The dashboard stops when the wingman
  unloads or Wingman AI closes.
- Chart.js is loaded from CDN (`cdn.jsdelivr.net`) — an internet connection is
  needed for charts to render. Core tables and data display work offline.

### Positions & Portfolio
- FIFO cost basis only — no support for LIFO, average cost, or specific
  identification methods.
- Unrealized P&L depends on UEX market prices, which may not reflect actual
  in-game terminal prices at the moment of sale.

### Planned Orders
- Auto-fulfillment uses case-insensitive substring matching (e.g. "Quantanium"
  matches "Quantanium (Raw)"). This may cause false matches on items with
  similar names.
- Sale orders can only be created for items already in the asset registry, open
  positions, or inventory.

### Inventory & Production
- These modules are **stubs** — basic tracking is available but full functionality
  is pending CIG's inventory system rework in Star Citizen.

## Optional Integrations

All integrations are optional. The skill works fully standalone via manual voice
entry and the web dashboard.

| Sibling Skill | What It Adds |
|---------------|-------------|
| **SC_LogReader** | Automatic trade capture from the game log. Commodity and item purchases/sales are imported without manual entry. |
| **UEXCorp** | Automatic ship purchase price lookup when registering fleet assets. Three-stage fuzzy name matching. |

To enable an integration, simply assign the sibling skill to the **same wingman**
as SC_Accountant. Detection is automatic at runtime.
